Polished version coming soon. :)</br></br>

I am 28, and I live in Cambridge, MA. I work for <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://pace.car">PACE Telematics</a> as an independent contractor. I was one of the earliest employees and used to work in Germany. I do mainly backend, from real time data pipelines to APIs, AI, and partner collaboration. </br></br> 

Before joining the Telematics industry, I worked on indoor navigation and did various agency projects, also in Germany. Before that, I worked in the health industry in Brazil. </br></br> 

After college, I did a freight exchange startup in my home country of Morocco called <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://wamova.com">Wamova</a>.</br></br> 

In addition to my varied technical responsibilities, I have a deep interest in linguistics, especially the generative paradigm.
